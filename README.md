This Batch file was made for a video on my Youtube channel: React Fever
This file opens a few programs at the beginning, then creates a loop which posts random characters onto the command prompt in green (obviously), once the loop hits 2000 times; it goes to :l2, which creates a .vbs file with a warning prompt before shutting the system down.
This File is NOT HARMFUL :)
